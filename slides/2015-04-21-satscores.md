# The plan:  

1. What were our goals?  What questions did we seek to answer? 
1. Where did we get our data? What are the problems with our data?
1. What parts of the data were interesting?
1. Demonstration of our code.
1. Discussion of our visualizations and results. 
1. What are the next steps?

# Goals
1. Visualizing poverty and other SES metrics with Scholastic Performance Standards.
1. Discover and display any correlations between assement data and community information. 

</section>

<section>
## Questions to Answer: 
1. Is there a correlation between SAT scores and other school information?
1. How do the schools' performance map with poverty and income in New York City?
1. Can we tell which schools are speciality schools on the map?

## Problems / Issues / Concerns with the Data

1. _Missing data:_ We lose a lot of data from schools that didn't report their scores.
1. _Time:_ The data we're using come from vastly different years.  
1. _Aggregation:_ Aggrating the information in a way that makes the most sense. (Zipcodes? Neighborhoods? School Districts? Boroughs?)

<section>
## Data Columns

_Pulled some variables that we thought might be important._

1. SAT scores 
1. Avg Household Income
1. school gender ratios, school class sizes
1. Safety concerns
