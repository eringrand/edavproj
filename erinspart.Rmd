Thinsg I've done: 
* Cluster the SAT scores with a simple KMEANS algorithm 
* Joined all the tables together with their cluster ID 
```{r, echo=False}
sat$total <- sat$math_avg + sat$critical_avg
satcl <- select(sat, -dbn, -num_taker)
cl <- kmeans(satcl, 3, nstart=25)
plot(satcl, col = cl$cluster)
points(cl$centers, col = 1:5, pch = 8)
clusters <- aggregate(satcl, by=list(cl$cluster), FUN=mean)
```

* Looked at the correlation / overlap between the three types of SAT scores
```{r}
grp_cols <- c("sat_norm","SATname")
dots <- lapply(grp_cols, as.symbol)

sathist <- df %>%
  group_by_(.dots=dots) %>%
  summarise(n=n())

ggplot(sathist, aes(x=sat_norm, color=SATname)) +
 geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, aes(fill=SATname))
```

* Looked at scatter plots of normalized feature vectors to see if they were visually correlated with SAT scores in any way.
