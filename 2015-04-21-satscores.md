# The plan:  

1. What were our goals?  What questions did we seek to answer? 
1. Where did we get our data? What are the problems with our data?
1. What parts of the data were interesting?
1. Demonstration of out code.
1. Discussion of our vizualitions and results. 
1. What are the next steps?

### Goals
1. Visualizing poverty and other SES metrics with Scholastic Performance Standards.

## Problems / Issues / Concerns with the Data

1. _Missing data:_ We lose a lot of data from schools that didn't report their scores.
1. _Time:_ The data we're using come from vastly different years.  
1. Aggrating the information in a way that makes the most sense. (Zipcodes? Neighborhoods? School Districts? Boroughs?)
