# SAT Scores for High Schools in New York City
_[Link to the our project repositiory](https://github.com/eringrand/edavproj)_


# The plan:  

1. What were our goals?  What questions did we seek to answer? 
1. Where did we get our data? What are the problems with our data?
1. What parts of the data were interesting?
1. Demonstration of out code.
1. Discussion of our vizualitions and results. 
1. What are the next steps?



# Goals
1. Visualizing poverty and other SES metrics with Scholastic Performance Standards.
1. Discover and display any correlations between assement data and community information. 


## Questions to Answer: 
1. Is there a correlation between SAT scores and other school information?
1. How do the school's performance map with poverty and income in New York City?
1. Can we tell which schools are speciality schools on the map?



# Data Sources 

1. [NYC OpenData SAT Scores 2012](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)
1. [NYC OpenData DOE High School Directory 2014-2015](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2)
1. [Income by ZipCode](http://zipatlas.com/us/city-comparison/median-household-income.html)
1. [Income by Neighborhood](http://furmancenter.org/research/sonychan/2013-state-of-new-york-citys-housing-and-neighborhoods-report)
1. Class Sizes 2010-2011
1. School Safety Report
1. Neighborhood Shape File


## Problems / Issues / Concerns with the Data

1. _Missing data:_ We lose a lot of data from schools that didn't report their scores.
1. _Time:_ The data we're using come from vastly different years.  
1. _Aggregation:_ Aggrating the information in a way that makes the most sense. (Zipcodes? Neighborhoods? School Districts? Boroughs?)


## Data Columns

_Pulled some variables that we thought might be important._

1. SAT scores 
1. Avg Household Income (by zip code)
1. school gender ratios, school class sizes
1. Safety concerns (violence and crimes)

## Data Mundging

1. Join all the tabels together
1. Get locations
1. [Sample Code - joinng tables]()
1. [Sample Code - ]() 


## Tools

1. For the data: R
1. For the map: D3


# Code Demonstration

1. R code for joining tables
1. R code for correlation 
1. Images

# Visualization

1. Link?
1. Image?
